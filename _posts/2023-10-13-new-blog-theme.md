You may have noticed some changes on my blog today. Thanks to the recent update of the "Chirpy" theme for Jekyll, it has received a fresh appearance and various functional improvements. The redesign aims to enhance readability and overall user experience with a cleaner layout, improved performance, and a moody dark style for low-light reading. Navigation menus have been refined for better content exploration, and my blog is now optimized for various devices. Your feedback is always appreciated as I continue to fine-tune this space for my (few) readers.
