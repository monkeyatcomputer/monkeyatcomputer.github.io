## Introduction

In the world of remote work and online collaboration, Microsoft Teams has emerged as a game-changer, facilitating communication and teamwork for millions of users worldwide. However, a recent change by Microsoft has confused the Teams ecosystem – the disabling of the much lauded Intelliframe feature.

## Understanding Intelliframe

A single, broad video of in-room attendees – the current standard – makes it difficult for remote attendees to clearly see faces and track who is speaking. With IntelliFrame, even in-room participants have a place in the video gallery. IntelliFrame enhances the focus and framing of in-room meeting attendees so that all meeting participants – including those in the room – have their own, individual frame in the video gallery. Remote participants will be able to see in-room participants’ faces better, making it easier to track who’s talking and read facial expressions, and helping them to feel more like they’re face-to-face.

## The Temporarily Disabled Support

In a surprising move, and without any announcement, it appears that Microsoft has taken Intelliframe away from us, only weeks after the feature became available. Why did Microsoft make this move? The only confirmation we've had is from a support ticket with no explanation given.

## What Does This Mean for Users?

Not a lot really. The feature had only just become available to Microsoft Teams Rooms systems, and many older devices do not support either the local Intelliframe camera, or Intelliframe in the Cloud.

## What's Next?

Microsoft has not provided any timeline for when Intelliframe support might return. However, it's reasonable to assume that the feature will make a comeback once what the issue that caused the feature to be disabled are addressed. In the meantime, users will just have to live with a single view of in-room participants.
