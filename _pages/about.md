## The Blog

Always appreciative of the knowledge freely given by others while trawling the internet for random error messages, this blog is my attempt to give something back.

... and so a blog is born. Hope you find some wisdom.

## The Protagonist

![Me](/assets/img/selfie.png)Have been around computers from a very early age and so was doomed to end up in IT. Before getting my first Pentium II 233MHz, there was always a [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro), [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Archimedes), A4 or [RiscPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiscPC) kicking around. Does anyone still argue over [CISC vs RISC](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=cisc+vs+risc)?

Working with Windows, Skype for Business, Lync, Office 365, Exchange, Azure, HTML, CSS, MSSQL, IIS, Microsoft.NET, Visual Studio, C#, Sonus, AudioCodes, Polycom, Pexip and many other technologies keeps me sane.

## The Day Job

Based in Melbourne Australia and, since 2011, a solutions consultant at [Generation-e](https://www.generation-e.com.au/), a leading Microsoft communications partner and reluctant accomplice.
